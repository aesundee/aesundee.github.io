## History of the Parish
For nearly two centuries, from 1578 to 1775, Camaligan fell under the ecclesiastical and civil authority of Nueva Caceres (now Naga City).

In 1775, the town gained autonomy under the governance of Bishop Domingo Ollantes of Nueva Caceres. However, it wasn't until 1795, during the tenure of Fray Rafael Benevente from the Franciscan mission, that the appointment of a parish priest solidified its independence.

A church, constructed with a combination of stones and wood, was erected but succumbed to fire in 1856.

Following the destruction of the original church, in 1857, under the leadership of Fray Juan Ontiveros as the parish priest, the current church structure was completed. It is believed that the friars aimed to eradicate the pre-colonial lifestyle and practices of the recently colonized town by building this church. Interestingly, the church stands on what used to be a burial ground during pre-colonial times.

## St. Anthony of Padua

After completing his education, St. Anthony, who was born in Lisbon in 1195, joined the Franciscans. Known for his stirring sermons, he rose to prominence and was named provincial superior in 1226. In 1228, he met Pope Gregory IX, which improved his status. He passed away at the age of 36 in Padua in 1231, following his well-known Lenten lectures. Pope Pius XII designated him a doctor of the church in 1946, and Pope Gregory IX proclaimed him a saint in 1232.

According to legend, St. Anthony is responsible for customs like mail guarding, almsgiving, and locating misplaced objects. On his feast day, there are still many people who do novenas and bless flowers. These customs depict St. Anthony as a modest yet powerful preacher who embodies bravery, love, forgiveness, and unshakable faith in God.
