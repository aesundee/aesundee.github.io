### Pre-debut Activities
TV station Mnet revealed the survival competition series I-Land on May 8, 2020. It is part of the cooperative effort that "follows the process of next generation K-pop artists being born" between the two entertainment firms. The program, which included 23 male trainees—some of whom had previously tried out for Belift and others who had transferred from Big Hit Music—formed Enhypen.
